* **Metadata**
	* **Tags:** #Note-taking 

A file organization method developed by [[@Tiago Forte]]. Separates into 4 folders:
1. **Projects** - A collection of files used for something that can be completed by an end date. Once the project is done it's moved to "Archive".
	- Examples: Coding project, Group assignments
2. **Areas** - Similar to [[Areas of Responsibility]] in [[Getting Things Done]]. Anything that is referred to occasionally and needs to be available on hand. It is also maintained over time.
	- Examples: Work, School, Home
3. **Resources** - A topic or theme of ongoing interest.
	- Examples: Sustainability, Music, Gardening
4. **Archive** - Anything that is not needed anymore from the 3 other folders are placed here.
