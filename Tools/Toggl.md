## Thoughts
* Requires practice to get into the habit of turning on and off timers
	* [[@CGP Grey]] seems to use "Unintentional" project for timers that may have gotten sidetracked by changing the project later to "Unintentional". Even though the time might be spent for learning, etc., it still doesn't change the fact that it became unintentionl when we went sidetracked
* Can help set intention when doing something
* [[Toggl setup]]
* I would like a calendar view to see how my time is spent, instead of a pie chart. While pie charts are useful to visualize how much time I've spent on an activity in absolute terms, it doesn't really visualize how I've spent my time in the context of my day.
