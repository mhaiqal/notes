- Set some boundaries
	- **Daily boundaries:** Set some restrictions on what time your work starts and end each day.
	- **Weekly boundaries:** Respect the weekend. Otherwise, you're setting yourself for burnout by not recharging each week.
	- **Monthly boundaries:** Take the time to step back and truly reset by getting uninterrupted rest away from home and work for 4+ days. He calls this a [[Deep Break]].
