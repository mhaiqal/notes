Instead of taking notes based on books, project, author, etc., notes written to be concept-oriented will be easier to form connections and update.

If your notes are based on books, projects, author, etc., you need to recall the name of the specific media in order to get the ideas you want. Additionally, if you come across the same idea but in another book, author, etc., you create a new note and you won't be able to build on that idea over time ([[Knowledge should accumulate]]).
