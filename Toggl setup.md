* Use [[Timery]] as the front end of [[Toggl]] on [[iOS]] and [[iPadOS]]
	* Save general activities (eating, gaming, journaling, reading, watching) as saved timers and add description later

## Projects
* Create projects by activities
	* Eating

	* Gaming
		* Put currently played game in description
	* Journaling

* Also have classes as projects
	* Put what you are doing and chapter or topic in description
	* Example: Study: Exam 2, Homework: Chapter 5
* Also have areas as projects
	* Use the description to describe the task done in the area
* Special "Unintentional" project for timers that have been sidetracked, like [[@CGP Grey]]
* `TODO: Think of what timer to use for writing things in [[Bear]]`
	* Right now it's just a Bear project with a "Writing" as the description
	* Brainstorm: 
		* Zettelkasten project? 
		* General writing project? 
			* Don't really like this because I'm planning on using "Writing" as the description for haiqalakmal.com area when I'm writing blogs, so I'd like to keep "Writing" as a description instead of project
