## Review
This book makes you really think about the world. It presents big ideas on how our future would change but does so it a very pragmatic way. The author also presents several viewpoints on a particular topic, to show us the bigger picture. There are some arguments that I disagree with, but that's just the nature of the book. It presents big ideas so that we can scrutinize and improve it for our future.

**Rating:** 4/5
