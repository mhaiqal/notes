In contrast to [[Deep Work]], Deep Break is a 4+ days uninterruped rest to detach from everything. It allows you to recharge and gain clarity. By stepping back, you get perspective on your life and work.

* **Rule \#1:** Get away from your home, city, and office.
	* Getting away from the city and into nature helps you calm and ground yourself.
* **Rule \#2:** Limit screen time.
	* Don't listen to current events.
* **Rule \#3:** Keep your work at home.
	* You might be afraid you'll fall into your old habit of laziness if you don't do work, but the point of the Deep Break is to take a step back and shut it all down.
